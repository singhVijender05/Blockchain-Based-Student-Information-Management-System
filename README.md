# Student Information Management System (SIMS)

## Overview

The Student Information Management System (SIMS) is a basic yet efficient project designed to manage student data effectively. Built with a blockchain-based contract to enhance security and integrity, this system demonstrates fundamental concepts in both student information management and smart contract implementation.

## Features

- **Student Data Management:** Manage student information including names, IDs, courses, and grades.
- **Blockchain Integration:** Utilizes basic blockchain contracts to ensure data integrity and security.
- **Efficient Operations:** Simple and effective interface for managing student records.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain Technology:** Basic contract implementation for data integrity.
- **Backend:** [Specify the backend technology used, e.g., Node.js, Express]
- **Frontend:** [Specify the frontend technology used, e.g., React.js]
- **Database:** [Specify the database technology used, e.g., MongoDB, SQL]
- **Version Control:** Git for source code management.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- [Specify any other prerequisites]

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/singhVijender05/Blockchain-Based-Student-Information-Management-System.git
cd Blockchain-Based-Student-Information-Management-System
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Start the Application

```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

1. **Add Student:** Enter student details into the form to add a new student record.
2. **View Students:** View the list of all students with their respective details.
3. **Update Student:** Edit student information as needed.
4. **Delete Student:** Remove a student record from the system.

## Contract Implementation

This project includes a basic blockchain contract for managing student data. The contract ensures that all operations on student records are secure and tamper-proof.
